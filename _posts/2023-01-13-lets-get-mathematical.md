### Ratios

Humans are born with a natural instinct to prefer patterns and sizes that are based on mathematical ratios. Musical notes sound pleasant together because they have a nice mathematical ratio — the notes C and G for example have a 3:2 ratio in sound frequency. Photographs usually have aspect ratios such as 16:9, 3:2, 4:3, or in the case of Instagram, 1:1. These are not picked at random — the human eye just prefers to look at things bearing these ratios.

We can use the idea of ratios in our web site designs too — mainly in our CSS, as this is where we are working with the look and feel of the sites. Let’s say we have a site that has a default font size of 14px:

body {

font-size: 14px;

}

It might be tempting to have titles in font sizes like 20px or 25px, which are nice round numbers, but the ratio of 25:14 or 20:14 (which factors down to 10:7) isn’t as nice of a ratio as 21px, which factors down from 21:14 to 3:2, just like in the musical notes and photograph aspect ratios we mentioned earlier:

h1 {

font-size: 21px;

}

Other font sizes that might work well would include 28px (2:1), 35px (5:2) and 42px (3:1). With a default font size of 16px, nice ratios we could use include 24px (3:2), 32px (2:1) and 40px (5:2). Notice how the sizes are close to the recommendations above, but visually they will make a lot of difference.

Dividing numbers

Some numbers are used pretty often in web design. You may see the numbers 360, 640, 960 and 1128 appear quite regularly, but why?

Mathematically, these numbers divide into lots of other rounded numbers. For instance, 960 divides nicely into 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, etc, whereas 980 or 940 don’t divide as neatly into lots of other numbers. It’s one of the reasons you see a lot of web pages which are 960px wide because it’s easier to make visually nicer layouts when you can divide in plenty of ways.

Margins and paddings

A lot of web design in our pages will use spacing — the idea that there will be some distance between different tags, or there’s some buffer around the tag.

If we want to move tags away from each other, we’ll use a new CSS rule called “margin”.

If we want to add a buffer around the tag, we’ll use a new CSS rule called “padding”.

Margins

Let’s say we want to add a 20 pixel space at the top and bottom of all our paragraphs so our content is easier to read. We want to push other tags away from each individual paragraph tag:

&lt;p&gt;

Going freelance means…

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

The first step is…

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

I’m not a fan…

&lt;/p&gt;

For our users, we want there to be a gap between the first &lt;p&gt; tag and the second &lt;p&gt; tag, then a gap between the second &lt;p&gt; tag and the third

&lt;p&gt; tag. If we add a fourth &lt;p&gt; tag later, we want there to be a gap too.

What we need to do is add a margin. In CSS, our margin takes four values: top, right, bottom, left. We start at the top and go clockwise around the tag. Some people remember the order as “TRouBLe” too (the capitals TRBL for the directions).

For our paragraphs, we want 20 pixels at the top and 20 pixels at the bottom. We’re not too fussed about the left or right having a margin so we can make them have zero margin:

p {

margin: 20px 0 20px 0;

}

We have four values in our margin rule, all separated by spaces.

If we decided that in fact we did want the left and the right sides to have the same margin as the top and bottom, we’d then have:

p {

margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;

}

This can be shortened to just:

p {

margin: 20px;

}

Having one value means all sides will have the same margin.

One thing to remember with margins is that the gap between two tags is an overlap not an addition. For example, if we have two paragraphs, each with 20 pixels margin, the gap between them is 20 pixels, not

40 pixels.

However if we have a header with a 30 pixel margin next to a paragraph with just a 20 pixel margin, the gap between would be 30 pixels, as whichever is the larger will push further.

Paddings

Margins push other tags further away from each other, but some of the time you might not want this to happen, but instead increase the size of the tag:

header {

background-color: red;

}

In our style sheet, we have a &lt;header&gt; tag with the background color red. The background will fill the space that the content fits into — it will stretch across the width of the tag and fill vertically, depending on the amount of content inside the tag. If we want to add a buffer around the content of the tag to make the red background color extend, we can use the padding rule.

This rule uses the same format as the margin rule — four values to go clockwise from the top to denote the top, right, bottom then left (remember “TRouBLe”):

header {

background-color: red; padding: 50px 100px 50px 100px;

}

In this rule, we are now making the background color have a buffer around the edge of any header tags.

Margins vs paddings

**Hi there,**

Again we can use just one value if we’re using the same padding around every side:

header {

background-color: red; padding: 50px;

}

I personally prefer to use all four values for both margins and paddings when I’m making web sites. A lot of web design is trial and error, so I’m constantly tweaking the layout, and it makes sense for me to tweak with four values rather than have to switch between four and one.

Combining margins and paddings

Margins and paddings aren’t a battle of “this or that”, you can use them both together in a lot of circumstances:

&lt;p&gt;

Going freelance means…

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=”highlight”&gt; The first step is…

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

I’m not a fan…

&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve taken the same HTML as before and added a class of “highlight” to the middle paragraph.

I want all my paragraphs to have a gap between them — 20 pixels on the top and bottom, 0 on the left and right.

With the middle paragraph, I want this to increase the gap between the other two, then have a yellow background with a buffer around it:

p {

margin: 20px 0 20px 0;

}

p.highlight {

margin: 30px 0 30px 0; padding: 40px 40px 40px 40px; background-color: yellow;

}

By using a class attribute, I’ve increased the margin to 30 pixels at the top and the bottom on the highlight &lt;p&gt; tags, then added a 40 pixel buffer around the whole tag with a yellow background on it.

For tags without a background, the visual difference between margin and paddings will be pretty much the same, either you’re extending a see-through background or you’re pushing away by that distance. In the

Automatic margins on the left and right of a tag

next section we will talk about borders which will make a difference to which you pick.

Automatic Margins

Margins combined with widths are good for pushing block tags like

&lt;header&gt; and &lt;div&gt; into the middle of other tags or the whole page, but sometimes we may not know how much margin we need.

For example, if we want the whole page to have a set width and to be in the center of the browser, we won’t know how much margin the whole page needs on the left and on the right. A user’s browser could be 900 pixels or 1900 pixels wide, so how do we tell the browser to add a margin that we don’t know the size of? We use the word “auto”.

Let’s say we want the page to be 800 pixels wide, we can move it into the middle by combining the width and the left and right margins:

body {

width: 800px;

margin: 0 auto 0 auto;

}

Unfortunately, “auto” only works for the left and right margin and it’s a bit trickier to move content vertically into the middle of page — we’ll talk more about that later.

Borders

To add borders to our tags, we can add a border rule in CSS. A border takes three values: a width, a border style and a color.

The width of the border is similar to the pixel values that we’ve been using so far. A thin border would be 1px, whereas a thicker border could be 10px.

The border styles we can use are dotted, dashed and solid. Almost all the time we’ll be using a solid one.

To add a thin solid white border to our &lt;header&gt; tag, we add:

header {

border: 1px solid white;

}

If we want to add a thicker solid bright yellow border to our &lt;p&gt; tags, we can add:

p {

border: 10px solid #fff182;

}

Specifying borders

You may not want borders around every part of the tag. You may just want a border on the left or on the bottom. You can be more specific by using the border-top, border-right, border-bottom and border-left rules:

p {

border-bottom: 1px solid #eeeeee;

}

header {

border-left: 5px solid #ff4141;

}

footer {

border-right: 10px solid white; border-top: 1px solid #9900ff;

}

In our example, we’re giving our &lt;p&gt; tags a thin light grey bottom border, our &lt;header&gt; tags a thicker solid red left border, then our

&lt;footer&gt; tags a thick white right border and a thin purple top border.

Using borders for underlined links

One of the more common ways to use borders is for underlines on links. Usually a link’s underline is a thin 1px border which is the same color as the text. By turning off the default underline (using the text-decoration rule) and replacing it with a border on the bottom, we can have a lot more control over how the underline looks.

We can even use transitions to make the border fade between two colors on hover:

a {

text-decoration: none;

border-bottom: 2px solid white; transition: border-bottom 0.5s;

}

a:hover {

border-bottom: 2px solid red;

}

Sometimes we want to fade in a border from nothing on hover. We would want to transition between a border with no color but a width, to a border with color and the same width:

a {

text-decoration: none;

border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transition: border-bottom: 0.5s;

}

a:hover {

border-bottom: 2px solid red;

}

The box model — borders, paddings and margins

If we combine borders, paddings and margins, the border will go around the buffer zone of the padding but not change with the size of the margin.

If we start from the very outer edge of the tag, we start by applying the margin, then add the border, apply a background if there is one, then add in the padding’s buffer zone, and then we have our actual content inside that.

The technical name for this is the box model — it’s how the boxes (or tags) of HTML are styled up and in what order.

Rounded corners with border radius

Most of the web design we’ve done so far has been in rectangles and squares, but sometimes we want to add rounded rectangles and circles.

Let’s say we want to make our &lt;header&gt; tag have slightly rounded corners, we can use the CSS rule border-radius to round the corners of our tag. Most of the time we would want our tag to have all rounded corners the same, so all we need to do is add one size value:

header {

background-color: red; border-radius: 10px;

}

In rarer cases, we might want to have all four corners rounded differently. Similarly to paddings and margins, we can add in four values. These values start in the top left corner and go around clockwise to the top right, bottom right then bottom left:

header {

background-color: red; border-radius: 10px 0 0 20px;

}

This example will give a rounded corner to just the top left (10px) and the bottom left (20px).

Making a circle

Let’s say we have a &lt;div&gt; tag and we give it a set height of 100px and a width of 100px. Without any border radius, we just have a square. When we start increasing our radius, the corners get further and further rounded. Once we hit 50px, half the height and half the width, our corners are so rounded that the whole tag will look circular:

div {

width: 100px; height: 100px;

background-color: red; border-radius: 50px;

}

If we try an even higher value, there’s no more corner to round, so it will still look like a 50px border radius, even if it says 200px.

Filters

Recently Adobe started added some of their own code to how CSS works to let us use some of the powerful Photoshop filters in our browsers. Because they are so new they may not work in some older browsers. For 90 percent of users they will work fine, but for those using older computers it may look as if these filters were never there. So for the moment, use sparingly until everyone else catches up (or buys new laptops).

We’re going to add a new rule called filter to our CSS. The first one lets us blur tags. Blur tags have a pixel unit, the larger the number, the more blur we have:

img {

filter: blur(2px);

}

We can also fade our image to gray by increasing another filter called grayscale:

img {

filter: grayscale(100%);

}

The default for this is 0% grayscale (so normal), but we can fade to gray by increasing the percentage to 100%.

Instead of gray, we could fade our image out to an antique sepia effect by using a similar filter:

img {

filter: sepia(50%);

}

Similar to grayscale, we can increase the saturation of the image too:

img {

filter: saturation(200%);

}

100% is the default saturation and anything less than 100% will reduce the saturation in the same way that grayscale works.

We can also change the contrast of the image in a similar way to saturation:

img {

filter: contrast(500%);

}

This will increase the contrast by five times the original. We can also change the brightness of the image:

img {

filter: brightness(200%);

}

We can invert the color of the tag too by adding an invert filter:

img {

filter: invert(100%);

}

We can also combine filters:

img {

filter: contrast(200%) grayscale(100%) blur(3px);

}

Where filters can come in really useful is in hover effects, for instance if we wanted to fade an image from gray into full color:

img {

filter: grayscale(100%); transition: filter 1s;

}

img:hover {

filter: grayscale(0);

}
